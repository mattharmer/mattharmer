          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>In the '90s, I elected computer programming in school. I used Basic on an Amstrad from home and was shown C+ and Java during school.</p>
          <p>In 2008 I started building websites for small businesses. In 2008 I started building websites for small businesses.</p>
          <p>In 2012 I purchased a computer repair and sales store which I ran for two years. I repaired over a hundred desktops, laptops, tablets and phones and supplied IT support services to many local business and individuals.</p>
          <h3>10 years and learning.</h3>
          <h4>IT Repairs & Support / HTML5 - CSS3</h4>
          <p>I continued to work on websites until 2018 when I chose to scale back the number of sites I managed, freeing up more time to build my skill set and further my career options.</p>

        <p>I am very passionate about IT support. Along with building their websites I continue help the below businesses with any IT support they may need.</p>
        <p> The projects below are from the past and reflect clients budget and older methods. I hope to update them in the future.</p>

              <h3>Craze Dance Academy Website</h3>
              <div class="project_craze"></div>
              <p>This site was initially built in 2012 and rebuilt using a responsive template with CMS in 2014 to provide an online hub for the students.</p>
              <p>Front-end login provides access to student content and photos. The dance office updates all site information.</p>

              <h3>Tatts Hotel Website</h3>
              <div class="project_tatts"></div>
              <p>Built-in 2013 for Tatts Hotel Inverell. I secured the domain before then, much to the ongoing pleasure of the owner.</p>
              <p>The Joomla site was bundled with on-site training and documentation to provide fast training of staff on updating the content of the site and sending newsletters.</p>
              <p>I also designed a simple typeface logo that the owners have used to re-brand the business print material.</p>

              <h3>John Williams Website</h3>
              <div class="project_senator"></div>
              <p>A senator who has since retired, his office is based in Inverell, NSW.</p>
              <p>Pre-2012 the first website had a transparent video introduction of the senator introducing himself and the website. It used a heavily modified template.</p>
              <p>The second iteration was a Joomla 1.5 to 2.5 migration and used available party branding guidelines for the template.</p>
              <p>The third build in 2016 was migrated from 2.5 to 3 along with branding changes there are numerous improvements current to the time.</p>

              <div class="project_mair"></div>
              <p>A stock and station real estate business built around 2011. This site has been migrated from Joomla 1.5 to 2.5 and seen two template changes.</p>
              <p>It uses modified extensions to list properties in ways that are particular to stock and station agents and a stripped back admin area UI for a user experience built for ease.</p>
              <p>The .pdf's of real estate properties generate from website listings to streamline the process of creating styled property A4 prints.</p>

              <div class="project_liberty"></div>
              <p>Built-in 2016 this is a cottage long or short term rental site.</p>
              <p>It has a CMS to give the owner the ability to add content to the site easily.</p>
              <p>Being a simple site, I was able to spend a more significant portion of time with site UX, responsive layout, logo, template and colour scheme.</p>
